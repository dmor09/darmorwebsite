                            <p>Leveraging our existing relationships and extensive network of candidates and clients is one of our greatest strengths.

                            <p>During this period, we perform periodic check-ins to ensure everything is progressing smoothly. We ask clients to monitor the candidate's performance against the goals established at the start of the search, and we invite candidates to provide feedback on their experience. From the very beginning of every search, we position ourselves as a trusted partner—and we continue to uphold that commitment long after the placement is complete.</p>
